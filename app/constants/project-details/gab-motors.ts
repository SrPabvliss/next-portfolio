  challenges: [
    {
      title: "Custom Calendar Implementation",
      description: "One of the most significant challenges was the lack of a suitable calendar library that met all our requirements. After evaluating several options, we determined that none provided the specific functionality needed for mechanic scheduling and appointment management. This necessitated building a custom calendar solution from scratch.",
      solution: "We addressed the calendar implementation challenge by creating a foundational calendar engine with pure JavaScript date manipulation, building three separate view components (day, week, month) that shared core logic, implementing a custom time slot system with conflict detection, and developing specialized mechanic availability visualization. We used CSS Grid for precise time slot positioning.",
      codeExample: `
const useCalendarWeek = ({ 
  scheduleWithEvents, 
  onChange, 
  onClick 
}: IUseCalendarWeek) => {
  const [week, setWeek] = useState<IDay[]>([]);
  const [date, setDate] = useState(new Date().toISOString());
  const [schedule, setSchedule] = useState<IScheduleWeek[]>(
    scheduleWithEvents.length ? scheduleWithEvents : scheduleWeek
  );

  // Generate week days based on current date
  useEffect(() => {
    setWeek(generateWeek(date));
  }, [date]);

  // Update schedule when events change
  useEffect(() => {
    setSchedule(scheduleWithEvents.length ? scheduleWithEvents : scheduleWeek);
  }, [scheduleWithEvents]);

  // Trigger event handlers when week changes
  useEffect(() => {
    if (week.length) {
      onChange(week[0].date, week[6].date);
    }
  }, [week]);

  // Handle event clicks
  const handleClickEvent = (date: string) => {
    onClick(date);
  };

  return { week, date, setDate, schedule, handleClickEvent };
};`
    },
    {
      title: "Real-Time Notifications System",
      description: "Implementing push notifications presented multiple challenges, particularly around device identification and token management. While Firebase provided a solid foundation, we still faced issues with browser-specific token generation behaviors, token refresh mechanisms, different notification display behaviors between foreground and background states, and creating campaigns to notify specific user groups based on roles.",
      solution: "We implemented a token registration and refresh strategy that stores tokens in the database, subscription management that ties devices to specific users, role-based notification targeting using Firebase Cloud Messaging, different notification templates for foreground and background states, and a persistent notification permission model with recovery options.",
      codeExample: `
async function create(createSubscriptionDto: CreateSubscriptionDto) {
  const encryptedEndpoint = await this.cryptoService.encryptString(
    createSubscriptionDto.token
  );

  // Check for existing subscriptions to prevent duplicates
  const subscriptions = await this.findAllByUser(createSubscriptionDto.userCI);
  if (subscriptions.length > 0) {
    const promise = subscriptions.map(async (subscription) => {
      const decrypted = await this.cryptoService.decryptString(
        subscription.token
      );
      if (decrypted === createSubscriptionDto.token) {
        throw new SubscriptionAlreadyExistsException();

      title: "Real-Time Communication Architecture",
      description: "The initial architecture didn't include WebSockets, but as development progressed, it became clear that real-time updates were essential for a collaborative scheduling environment. Implementing Socket.io required significant refactoring to create proper channel structures, establish event patterns, handle connection states, and maintain socket authentication across sessions.",
      solution: "To implement real-time communication, we created separated WebSocket gateways for different features (appointments, reminders), established room-based communication channels for administrators and mechanics, implemented event-driven architecture for notifications, and added reconnection handling with session persistence.",
      codeExample: `
@WebSocketGateway({
  cors: {
    origin: '*',
  },
})
export class AppointmentsGateway {
  @WebSocketServer()
  server: Server;

  private allowedRoles: Role[] = [
    'ADMIN',

      title: "Performance Optimization",
      description: "The modular architecture initially caused performance issues as modules were being loaded regardless of whether they were actively used. This resulted in unnecessary network requests and slower initial page loads.",
      solution: "To address performance issues, we implemented lazy loading for non-critical modules, code splitting based on user roles and access patterns, strategic data prefetching for common navigation paths, query result caching with React Query, and optimistic UI updates to improve perceived performance."
    },
    {
      title: "Browser Compatibility",
      description: "iOS Safari presented unique challenges, particularly with push notifications. The token generation and management behaved differently from other browsers, requiring special handling.",
      solution: "For iOS Safari support, we implemented browser detection and conditional token handling, created a notification reactivation feature for recovering lost subscriptions, built fallback notification patterns using local storage and polling, and added detailed logging for troubleshooting device-specific issues."
