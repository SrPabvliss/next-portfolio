      title: "Document Collaboration and Versioning",
      description: "One of the most significant challenges was building a system that could track collaborative work across multiple users while maintaining a comprehensive history of changes. This was particularly critical for official documents that required strict auditing and version control.",
      solution: "We implemented a robust version control system integrated with Google Drive that tracked every document change, who made it, and when. This solution included a custom template variable system that maintained document integrity across revisions while providing clear visualization of the document's state and history."
    },
    {
      title: "Legacy System Migration",
      description: "Adapting functionality from GenDocs V1 and V2 into the new system presented significant hurdles. We needed to ensure data continuity while improving the architecture and user experience, requiring careful migration strategies to prevent data loss.",
      solution: "We developed a phased migration approach that preserved legacy data while incrementally adding new features. This included creating compatibility layers that translated old data formats into the new schema, running parallel systems during transition, and providing extensive training for administrative staff to ensure a smooth transition."
    },
    {
      title: "State Management Optimization",
      description: "Managing application state efficiently across multiple modules proved challenging. We needed to minimize unnecessary API refetching while ensuring data consistency across the application, particularly for complex workflows like certificate generation.",
      solution: "I implemented a comprehensive solution using Zustand that reduced unnecessary API calls by caching data appropriately, improved perceived performance through optimistic UI updates, maintained data consistency across different views, and provided persistence for critical application state through the session storage API.",
      codeExample: `
export const useStudentStore = create<StoreState>(

      title: "Excel Format Inconsistencies",
      description: "The lack of standardized Excel formats for data import was a persistent challenge. Each department often used their own formats, requiring adaptable parsing solutions that could handle a wide variety of input structures.",
      solution: "To address this, I implemented a flexible parsing solution that could handle multiple naming conventions for the same data, providing clear error messages for problematic records, maintaining backward compatibility with legacy formats, and gradually encouraging standardization through user feedback.",
      codeExample: `
export const transformData = (data: any[], careers: ICareer[], canton: ICanton[]): any =>
