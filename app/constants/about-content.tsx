	mainContent: `My journey in web development began just before finishing high school, sparking an interest that led me to pursue Software Engineering. While university provided my foundation, my real growth came through hands-on experience with side projects—starting with websites for marketing competitions and eventually landing my first paid e-commerce project.

Over time, I've built a network of like-minded collaborators, taking on increasingly complex and better-compensated projects. This project-based approach explains my varied work history; rather than long-term contracts, I've thrived in dynamic, goal-oriented environments where I can deliver complete solutions.`,

	whatIDo: `As a developer who thrives at the intersection of code and creativity, I specialize primarily in frontend development while maintaining strong full-stack capabilities. Recently, I've expanded into mobile development using React Native, allowing me to move fluidly between web and mobile platforms.

My development philosophy centers on clean, readable code with clear separation of concerns. I believe in balancing elegant architecture with practical solutions—crafting frontend experiences that intuitively serve users and backend systems that seamlessly support frontend implementation.`,

	howIWork: `My approach is highly visual and user-centered. I begin by visualizing the desired outcome, understanding user needs, and creating conceptual mocks. I verbalize the intended interactions and proposed solutions before evaluating technical viability and implementation complexity.

This blend of creative thinking and technical problem-solving helps me deliver solutions that work not just technically, but holistically.`,

	beyondCode: `When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing music—guitar, piano, bass, and vocals—or applying what I've learned about music production. I'm also committed to physical fitness and regular gym training.

I'm currently seeking opportunities with organizations that value continuous learning and growth. While frontend roles align best with my passions, I'm most interested in joining a culture where I can both contribute my skills and continue expanding my capabilities.`,
